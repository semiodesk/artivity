.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBInkscape\fR is a \s-1GUI\s0 editor for \fBScalable Vector Graphics (\s-1SVG\s0)\fR format
drawing files, with capabilities similar to \fBAdobe Illustrator\fR,
\&\fBCorelDraw\fR, \fBXara Xtreme\fR, etc. Inkscape features include versatile
shapes, bezier paths, freehand drawing, multi-line text, text on path,
alpha blending, arbitrary affine transforms, gradient and pattern fills, node
editing, many export and import formats including \s-1PNG\s0 and \s-1PDF,\s0 grouping, 
layers, live clones, and a lot more.  The interface is
designed to be comfortable and efficient for skilled users, while
remaining conformant to \fB\s-1GNOME\s0\fR standards so that users familiar with
other \s-1GNOME\s0 applications can learn its interface rapidly.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1SVG\s0\fR is a W3C standard \s-1XML\s0 format for 2D vector drawing. It allows
defining objects in the drawing using points, paths, and primitive
shapes.  Colors, fonts, stroke width, and so forth are specified as
`style' attributes to these objects.  The intent is that since \s-1SVG\s0 is a
standard, and since its files are text/xml, it will be
possible to use \s-1SVG\s0 files in a sizeable number of programs and for a
wide range of uses.
.PP
\&\fBInkscape\fR uses \s-1SVG\s0 as its native document format, and has the goal of
becoming the most fully compliant drawing program for \s-1SVG\s0 files
available in the Open Source community.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 8
.IX Item "-?, --help"
Show help message
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR" 8
.IX Item "-V, --version"
Show Inkscape version and build date.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR \fIx0:y0:x1:y1\fR, \fB\-\-export\-area\fR=\fIx0:y0:x1:y1\fR" 8
.IX Item "-a x0:y0:x1:y1, --export-area=x0:y0:x1:y1"
In \s-1PNG\s0 export, set the exported area in \s-1SVG\s0 user units (anonymous length units normally used
in Inkscape \s-1SVG\s0).  The default is to export the entire document page.  The point (0,0)
is the lower-left corner.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-export\-area\-page\fR" 8
.IX Item "-C, --export-area-page"
In \s-1PNG, PDF, PS,\s0 and \s-1EPS\s0 export, exported area is the page. This is the default
for \s-1PNG, PDF,\s0 and \s-1PS,\s0 so you don't need to specify this unless you are using \-\-export\-id 
to export a specific object. In \s-1EPS,\s0 however, this is not the default; moreover, for \s-1EPS, \s0
the specification of the format does not allow its bounding box to extend beyond its content. 
This means that when \-\-export\-area\-page is used with \s-1EPS\s0 export, the page bounding box 
will be trimmed inwards to the bounding box of the content if it is smaller.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-export\-area\-drawing\fR" 8
.IX Item "-D, --export-area-drawing"
In \s-1PNG, PDF, PS,\s0 and \s-1EPS\s0 export, exported area is the drawing (not page), i.e. the bounding box
of all objects of the document (or of the exported object if \-\-export\-id is used). 
With this option, the exported image will
display all the visible objects of the document without margins or cropping. This is the default
export area for \s-1EPS.\s0 For \s-1PNG,\s0 it can be used in combination with \-\-export\-use\-hints.
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-area\-snap\fR" 8
.IX Item "--export-area-snap"
For \s-1PNG\s0 export, snap the export area outwards to the nearest integer \s-1SVG\s0 user unit (px) values. If you are using the 
default export resolution of 90 dpi and your graphics are pixel-snapped to minimize antialiasing, this switch 
allows you to preserve this alignment even if you are exporting some object's bounding 
box (with \-\-export\-id or \-\-export\-area\-drawing) which is itself not pixel-aligned.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fI\s-1COLOR\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-background\fR=\fI\s-1COLOR\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-b COLOR, --export-background=COLOR"
Background color of exported \s-1PNG.\s0
This may be any \s-1SVG\s0 supported color string, for example \*(L"#ff007f\*(R" or \*(L"rgb(255, 0, 128)\*(R".
If not set,
then the page color set in Inkscape in the Document Options dialog will be used (stored in the pagecolor= attribute of sodipodi:namedview).
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fI\s-1DPI\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-dpi\fR=\fI\s-1DPI\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-d DPI, --export-dpi=DPI"
The resolution used for \s-1PNG\s0 export.
It is also used for fallback rasterization of filtered objects
when exporting to \s-1PS, EPS,\s0 or \s-1PDF \s0(unless you specify \-\-export\-ignore\-filters to suppress
rasterization). The default is 90 dpi, which corresponds to 1 \s-1SVG\s0 user unit 
(px, also called \*(L"user unit\*(R") exporting to 1 bitmap pixel.
This value overrides the \s-1DPI\s0 hint if used with \-\-export\-use\-hints.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-png\fR=\fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-e FILENAME, --export-png=FILENAME"
Specify the filename for \s-1PNG\s0 export.
If it already exists, the file will be overwritten without asking.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-f FILENAME, --file=FILENAME"
Open specified document(s).
Option string may be omitted, i.e. you can list the filenames without \-f.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-with\-gui\fR" 8
.IX Item "-g, --with-gui"
Try to use the \s-1GUI \s0(on Unix, use the X server even if \f(CW$DISPLAY\fR is not set).
.IP "\fB\-h\fR \fI\s-1HEIGHT\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-height\fR=\fI\s-1HEIGHT\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-h HEIGHT, --export-height=HEIGHT"
The height of generated bitmap in pixels.
This value overrides the \-\-export\-dpi setting (or the \s-1DPI\s0 hint if used with \-\-export\-use\-hints).
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fI\s-1ID\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-id\fR=\fI\s-1ID\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-i ID, --export-id=ID"
For \s-1PNG, PS, EPS, PDF\s0 and plain \s-1SVG\s0 export, the id attribute value of the object that you want 
to export from the document; all other objects are not exported.  By
default the exported area is the bounding box of the object; you can override this using
\&\-\-export\-area (\s-1PNG\s0 only) or \-\-export\-area\-page.
.IP "\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-export\-id\-only\fR" 8
.IX Item "-j, --export-id-only"
For \s-1PNG\s0 and plain \s-1SVG,\s0 only export the object whose id is given in \-\-export\-id. All other objects are hidden and won't 
show in export even if they overlay the exported object. 
Without \-\-export\-id, this option is ignored. For \s-1PDF\s0 export, this is the default, so this option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-export\-plain\-svg\fR=\fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-l, --export-plain-svg=FILENAME"
Export document(s) to plain \s-1SVG\s0 format, without sodipodi: or inkscape: namespaces and without \s-1RDF\s0 metadata.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-extension\-directory\fR" 8
.IX Item "-x, --extension-directory"
Lists the current extension directory that Inkscape is configured to use and
then exits.  This is used for external extension to use the same configuration
as the original Inkscape installation.
.IP "\fB\-\-verb\-list\fR" 8
.IX Item "--verb-list"
Lists all the verbs that are available in Inkscape by \s-1ID. \s0 This \s-1ID\s0 can be
used in defining keymaps or menus.  It can also be used with the \-\-verb
command line option.
.IP "\fB\-\-verb\fR=\fIVERB\-ID\fR, \fB\-\-select\fR=\fIOBJECT\-ID\fR" 8
.IX Item "--verb=VERB-ID, --select=OBJECT-ID"
These two options work together to provide some basic scripting for
Inkscape from the command line.  They both can occur as many times as
needed on the command line and are executed in order on every document that
is specified.
.Sp
The \-\-verb command will execute a specific verb as if it
was called from a menu or button.  Dialogs will appear if that is part
of the verb.  To get a list of the verb IDs available, use the \-\-verb\-list
command line option.
.Sp
The \-\-select command will cause objects that have the \s-1ID\s0
specified to be selected.  This allows various verbs to act upon them.  To
remove all the selections use \-\-verb=EditDeselect.  The object IDs
available are dependent on the document specified to load.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fI\s-1PRINTER\s0\fR, \fB\-\-print\fR=\fI\s-1PRINTER\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-p PRINTER, --print=PRINTER"
Print document(s) to the specified printer using `lpr \-P \s-1PRINTER\s0'.
Alternatively, use `| \s-1COMMAND\s0' to specify a different command to pipe to,
or use `> \s-1FILENAME\s0' to write the PostScript output to a file instead of printing.
Remember to do appropriate quoting for your shell, e.g.
.Sp
inkscape \-\-print='| ps2pdf \- mydoc.pdf' mydoc.svg
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-export\-use\-hints\fR" 8
.IX Item "-t, --export-use-hints"
Use export filename and \s-1DPI\s0 hints stored in the exported object (only with \-\-export\-id).
These hints are set automatically when you export selection from within Inkscape.
So, for example, if you export a shape with id=\*(L"path231\*(R" as /home/me/shape.png at 300 dpi from document.svg using Inkscape \s-1GUI,\s0 and save the document,
then later you will be able to reexport that shape to the same file with the same resolution simply with
.Sp
inkscape \-i path231 \-t document.svg
.Sp
If you use \-\-export\-dpi, \-\-export\-width, or \-\-export\-height with this option,
then the \s-1DPI\s0 hint will be ignored and the value from the command line will be used.
If you use \-\-export\-png with this option,
then the filename hint will be ignored and the filename from the command line will be used.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR \fI\s-1WIDTH\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-width\fR=\fI\s-1WIDTH\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-w WIDTH, --export-width=WIDTH"
The width of generated bitmap in pixels.
This value overrides the \-\-export\-dpi setting (or the \s-1DPI\s0 hint if used with \-\-export\-use\-hints).
.IP "\fB\-y\fR \fI\s-1VALUE\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-background\-opacity\fR=\fI\s-1VALUE\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-y VALUE, --export-background-opacity=VALUE"
Opacity of the background of exported \s-1PNG.\s0
This may be a value either between 0.0 and 1.0 (0.0 meaning full transparency, 1.0 full opacity)
or greater than 1 up to 255 (255 meaning full opacity).
If not set and the \-b option is not used,
then the page opacity set in Inkscape in the Document Options dialog will be used (stored in the inkscape:pageopacity= attribute of sodipodi:namedview).
If not set but the \-b option is used,
then the value of 255 (full opacity) will be used.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR \fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-ps\fR=\fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-P FILENAME, --export-ps=FILENAME"
Export document(s) to PostScript format. Note that PostScript does not support transparency, so any transparent objects in the original \s-1SVG\s0 will be automatically rasterized. Used fonts are subset and embedded. The default export area is page; you can set it to drawing by \-\-export\-area\-drawing. You can 
specify \-\-export\-id to export a single object (all other are hidden); in that case 
export area is that object's bounding box, but can be set to page by \-\-export\-area\-page.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR \fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-eps\fR=\fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-E FILENAME, --export-eps=FILENAME"
Export document(s) to Encapsulated PostScript format. Note that PostScript does not support transparency, so any transparent objects in the original \s-1SVG\s0 will be automatically rasterized. Used fonts are subset and embedded. The default export area is drawing; you can set it to page, however see \-\-export\-area\-page for applicable limitation. You can specify \-\-export\-id to export a single object (all other are hidden).
.IP "\fB\-A\fR \fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR, \fB\-\-export\-pdf\fR=\fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR" 8
.IX Item "-A FILENAME, --export-pdf=FILENAME"
Export document(s) to \s-1PDF\s0 format. This format preserves the 
transparency in the original \s-1SVG.\s0 Used fonts are subset and embedded. 
The default export area is page; you can set it to drawing by \-\-export\-area\-drawing. You can 
specify \-\-export\-id to export a single object (all other are hidden); in that case 
export area is that object's bounding box, but can be set to page by \-\-export\-area\-page.
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-pdf\-version\fR=\fIPDF\-VERSION\fR" 8
.IX Item "--export-pdf-version=PDF-VERSION"
Select the \s-1PDF\s0 version of the exported \s-1PDF\s0 file. This option basically
exposes the \s-1PDF\s0 version selector found in the PDF-export dialog of the
\&\s-1GUI.\s0 You must provide one of the versions from that combo-box,
e.g. \*(L"1.4\*(R". The default pdf export version is \*(L"1.4\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-latex\fR" 8
.IX Item "--export-latex"
(for \s-1PS, EPS,\s0 and \s-1PDF\s0 export)
Used for creating images for LaTeX documents, where the image's text is typeset by LaTeX.
When exporting to \s-1PDF/PS/EPS\s0 format, this option splits the output into a \s-1PDF/PS/EPS\s0 file 
(e.g. as specified by \-\-export\-pdf) and a LaTeX file. Text will not be output in 
the \s-1PDF/PS/EPS\s0 file, but instead will appear in the LaTeX file. This LaTeX file 
includes the \s-1PDF/PS/EPS.\s0 Inputting (\einput{image.tex}) the LaTeX file in your LaTeX
document will show the image and all text will be typeset by LaTeX. See the
resulting LaTeX file for more information.
Also see GNUPlot's `epslatex' output terminal.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-export\-text\-to\-path\fR" 8
.IX Item "-T, --export-text-to-path"
Convert text objects to paths on export, where applicable (for \s-1PS, EPS, PDF\s0 and \s-1SVG\s0 export).
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-ignore\-filters\fR" 8
.IX Item "--export-ignore-filters"
Export filtered objects (e.g. those with blur) as vectors, ignoring the filters (for \s-1PS, EPS,\s0 and \s-1PDF\s0 export). 
By default, all filtered objects are rasterized at \-\-export\-dpi (default 90 dpi), preserving the appearance.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-query\-id\fR" 8
.IX Item "-I, --query-id"
Set the \s-1ID\s0 of the object whose dimensions are queried. If not set, query options will 
return the dimensions of the drawing (i.e. all document objects), not the page or viewbox
.IP "\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-query\-x\fR" 8
.IX Item "-X, --query-x"
Query the X coordinate of the drawing or, if specified, of the object with \-\-query\-id. The returned value is in px (\s-1SVG\s0 user units).
.IP "\fB\-Y\fR, \fB\-\-query\-y\fR" 8
.IX Item "-Y, --query-y"
Query the Y coordinate of the drawing or, if specified, of the object with \-\-query\-id. The returned value is in px (\s-1SVG\s0 user units).
.IP "\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-query\-width\fR" 8
.IX Item "-W, --query-width"
Query the width of the drawing or, if specified, of the object with \-\-query\-id. The returned value is in px (\s-1SVG\s0 user units).
.IP "\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-query\-height\fR" 8
.IX Item "-H, --query-height"
Query the height of the drawing or, if specified, of the object with \-\-query\-id. The returned value is in px (\s-1SVG\s0 user units).
.IP "\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-query\-all\fR" 8
.IX Item "-S, --query-all"
Prints a comma delimited listing of all objects in the \s-1SVG\s0 document with
IDs defined, along with their x, y, width, and height values.
.IP "\fB\-\-shell\fR" 8
.IX Item "--shell"
With this parameter, Inkscape will enter an interactive command line shell mode. In this
mode, you type in commands at the prompt and Inkscape executes them, without you having
to run a new copy of Inkscape for each command. This feature is mostly useful for
scripting and server uses: it adds no new capabilities but allows you to improve the
speed and memory requirements of any script that repeatedly calls Inkscape to perform
command line tasks (such as export or conversions). Each command in shell mode must be a
complete valid Inkscape command line but without the Inkscape program name, for example
\&\*(L"file.svg \-\-export\-pdf=file.pdf\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-\-vacuum\-defs\fR" 8
.IX Item "--vacuum-defs"
Remove all unused items from the <lt>defs<gt> section of the \s-1SVG\s0 file.  If this
option is invoked in conjunction with \-\-export\-plain\-svg, only the exported file
will be affected.  If it is used alone, the specified file will be modified in place.
.IP "\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-without\-gui\fR" 8
.IX Item "-z, --without-gui"
Do not open the \s-1GUI \s0(on Unix, do not use X server); only process the files from console.
This is assumed for \-p, \-e, \-l, and \-\-vacuum\-defs options.
.IP "\fB\-\-g\-fatal\-warnings\fR" 8
.IX Item "--g-fatal-warnings"
This standard \s-1GTK\s0 option forces any warnings, usually harmless, to cause Inkscape to
abort (useful for debugging).
.IP "\fB\-\-usage\fR" 8
.IX Item "--usage"
Display a brief usage message.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
The main configuration file is located in ~/.config/inkscape/preferences.xml; it stores
a variety of customization settings that you can change in Inkscape (mostly in the
Inkscape Preferences dialog).  Also in the subdirectories there, you can place your own:
.PP
\&\fB\f(CB$HOME\fB\fR/.config/inkscape/extensions/ \- extension effects.
.PP
\&\fB\f(CB$HOME\fB\fR/.config/inkscape/icons/ \- icons.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
The program returns zero on success or non-zero on failure.
.PP
A variety of error messages and warnings may be printed to \s-1STDERR\s0 or
\&\s-1STDOUT. \s0 If the program behaves erratically with a particular \s-1SVG\s0 file
or crashes, it is useful to look at this output for clues.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
While obviously \fBInkscape\fR is primarily intended as a \s-1GUI\s0 application,
it can be used for doing \s-1SVG\s0 processing on the command line as well.

To load different icons sets instead of the default
\&\fB\f(CB$PREFIX\fB\fR/share/inkscape/icons/icons.svg file, the directory
\&\fB\f(CB$HOME\fB\fR/.config/inkscape/icons/ is used.  Icons are loaded by name
(e.g. \fIfill_none.svg\fR), or if not found, then from \fIicons.svg\fR.  If the
icon is not loaded from either of those locations, it falls back to the
default system location.
.PP
The needed icons are loaded from \s-1SVG\s0 files by searching for the \s-1SVG\s0 id with
the matching icon name.  (For example, to load the \*(L"fill_none\*(R" icon from
a file, the bounding box seen for \s-1SVG\s0 id \*(L"fill_none\*(R" is rendered as the
icon, whether it comes from \fIfill_none.svg\fR or \fIicons.svg\fR.)

.SH "HISTORY"
.IX Header "HISTORY"
The codebase that would become Inkscape began life in 1999 as the
program Gill, the \s-1GNOME\s0 Illustrator application, created by Raph
Levien.  The stated objective for Gill was to eventually support all of
\&\s-1SVG. \s0 Raph implemented the PostScript bezier imaging model, including
stroking and filling, line cap style, line join style, text, etc.
Raph's Gill page is at http://www.levien.com/svg/.  Work on Gill appears
to have slowed or ceased in 2000.
.PP
The next incarnation of the codebase was to become the highly popular
program Sodipodi, led by Lauris Kaplinski.  The codebase was turned
into a powerful illustration program over the course of several
year's work, adding several new features, multi-lingual support, porting
to Windows and other operating systems, and eliminating dependencies.
.PP
Inkscape was formed in 2003 by four active Sodipodi developers, Bryce
Harrington, MenTaLguY, Nathan Hurst, and Ted Gould, wanting to take a
different direction with the codebase in terms of focus on
\&\s-1SVG\s0 compliance, interface look-and-feel, and a desire to open
development opportunities to more participants.  The project progressed
rapidly, gaining a number of very active contributors and features.
.PP
Much work in the early days of the project focused on code stabilization
and internationalization.  The original renderer inherited from Sodipodi
was laced with a number of mathematical corner cases which led to
unexpected crashes when the program was pushed beyond routine uses; this
renderer was replaced with Livarot which, while not perfect either, was
significantly less error prone.  The project also adopted a practice of
committing code frequently, and encouraging users to run developmental
snapshots of the program; this helped identify new bugs swiftly, and
ensure it was easy for users to verify the fixes.  As a result, Inkscape
releases have generally earned a reputation for being robust and
reliable.
.PP
Similarly, efforts were taken to internationalize and localize the
interface, which has helped the program gain contributors worldwide.
.PP
Inkscape has had a beneficial impact on the visual attractiveness of
Open Source in general, by providing a tool for creating and sharing
icons, splash screens, website art, and so on.  In a way, despite being
\&\*(L"just an drawing program\*(R", Inkscape has played an important role in
making Open Source more visually stimulating to larger audiences.
