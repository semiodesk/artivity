howto create windows msi installer

you need:
1. windows installer XML installed and callable from your path
   get it from http://wixtoolset.org/
   Because of a bug in the current version of wix the installer works using version 3.7 only.

build the installer
1. build inkscape
2. open command shell "cmd"
3. change current directory to inkscape\packaging\wix
4. set environment variables
   wixenv.bat
5. create installer using batch
   install.bat

when completed there should be inkscape.msi in your path
