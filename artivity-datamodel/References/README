CUSTOM LIBS REQUIRED

We need to reference a custom build OpenLink.Data.Virtuoso.dll here, because the 
one which is supplied by dotNetRdf and OpenLink references the System.Data.Entity.dll
which is not available with a default Mono setup on Ubuntu 14.04.

We're hoping to resolve the issue in cooperation with the dotNetRdf project. Once
this is the case we can remove the references here.
