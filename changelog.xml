		<description>With this release we decided to finally go public with Artivity.
	  We have put in a lot of time and work and it turned out to be an awesome piece of software.
		But please keep in mind that this is only the first release and the edges are still a bit rough.
		This is the reason why we named this release after the cave drawings of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Altamira'>Altamira</a>.
	  <p/>
		Thank you for helping us test Artivity and please report any problems to our <a href='https://bitbucket.org/semiodesk/artivity/issues'>issue tracker</a>.

		<note>Added an installation mechanism form plugins.</note>
		<note>Completed major restructuring of the data model.</note>
		<note>Improved data capture mechanisms in all plugins.</note>
